I'm interested in rare, extreme galaxies that formed early in cosmic history, or as I affectionately call them, "bright and early" galaxies. They are massive,
are often bursting with star formation or have recently retired from a
starburst phase, and are luminous in some wavelength regime. They assemble rapidly and undergo
huge transformations all within the first billion or so years of
the Universe. How did these
galaxies get so bright? How did they form and grow so early? Does the existence
of these "bright and early" galaxies suggest that the Universe is a
morning person?

To answer these questions, I observe these "bright and early"
galaxies using various instruments spanning wavelength
regimes, from submillimeter arrays to classic optical
telescopes. Check out my papers and research topics below.
