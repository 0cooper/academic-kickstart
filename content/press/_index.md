## [Astrobites](https://astrobites.org/author/ocooper/)

### [Quench your inner star formation](https://astrobites.org/2022/09/10/laes-quench-star-formation/)

Does one galaxy’s star formation quench another’s? Find out in today’s astrobite.

### [Bright galaxies blowing bubbles](https://astrobites.org/2022/08/06/galaxies-blow-ionized-bubbles/)

Today’s paper takes a clear view of bubbles blown by bright galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization

### [Meet the AAS Keynote Speakers: Prof. Gail Zasowski](https://astrobites.org/2022/06/15/meet-the-aas-keynote-speakers-gail-zasowski/)

We sit down with Professor Gail Zasowski, plenary speaker at #AAS240, to hear about new techniques to understand the Milky Way Galaxy from the inside!

### [Big, bright, bursty, AND early: what are the odds?](https://astrobites.org/2022/06/07/rare-starburst-obscured-agn/)

Just how rare is this hyperluminous heavily obscured active galactic nucleus in a dusty starburst in the early Universe?

### [Can you explain these long dark gaps in your cosmological resume?](https://astrobites.org/2022/05/16/long-dark-gaps/)

Find out how dark gaps can help fill in gaps in our knowledge of reionization


### [Earth Week x Astrobites 2022: Introducing our speakers!](https://astrobites.org/2022/04/18/earthweek2022-blurbs/)

To kick off #EarthWeekxAstrobites2022 we introduce our speakers and how they integrate astro/physics and climate work in their careers!


### [A serving of X-rays in a stack of galaxies](https://astrobites.org/2022/03/22/galaxy-pancake-stacks/)

Quiescent galaxy pancakes are filled with berry jam across cosmic time, and other lessons from galaxy stacking

### [Forecasting the obscured first few billion years](https://astrobites.org/2022/02/22/jwst-forecast/)

What will JWST reveal about the obscured early Universe? Today’s authors process simulations to find out


### [Rethinking the science conference format](https://astrobites.org/2022/01/10/virtual-conference-format/)

How can we format science meetings to better serve all of us? Recent studies have a few recommendations


### [What do enormous, fabulous slugs have to do with giant galaxy formation?](https://astrobites.org/2021/12/13/elan-to-elliptical/)

Before giant galaxies, it was all slugs, mammoths, and big nebulous blobs of emission: find out why in today’s astrobite!


### [Catching High Energy Photons Leaking from Holey Galaxies](https://astrobites.org/2021/11/09/catching-a-lyc-leak/)

Today’s paper works to catch a leak with a new technique, using resolved Lyman-alpha line profiles to gain insight into the epoch of reionization

### [A Requiem for Dead Galaxies](https://astrobites.org/2021/09/30/requiem-for-dead-galaxies/)

Traces of magnified dust offer a requiem to early, dead galaxies that
ran out of gas

### [Replacing our constellations with satellites](https://astrobites.org/2021/09/10/satellite-constellations/)

As satellite constellations crowd our night sky, today’s authors
advocate for space as a globally shared resource rather than an entity
to be owned and controlled

### [An Extreme, Distant Quasar in the Cosmic House of Mirrors](https://astrobites.org/2021/08/19/quasar-house-of-mirrors/)

Step into the cosmic house of mirrors at this quasar party at dawn!

### [Blazing Hot DOGs at the Cosmic BBQ](https://astrobites.org/2021/07/21/cosmic-bbq-hot-dogs/)

Blazing Hot DOGs, in MY early Universe? It’s more likely than you think…Find out what happens at this particularly turbulent BBQ!

### [Gotta catch ’em all: the first neutron star-black hole merger detection!](https://astrobites.org/2021/06/30/first-nsbh-merger/)

Welcome to the family plot, NSBH! Learn more about LIGO’s two new additions to the stellar graveyard.

### [A Resolved Starburst Merger and an Unresolved Dust Problem](https://astrobites.org/2021/03/19/resolved-starburst-merger/)

What’s going on behind the dust in starburst galaxy SHiZELS-14?
Today’s authors use highly resolved data to find out!


### [Distant, Dusty Galaxy Hiding in the Dark](https://astrobites.org/2021/02/13/distant-dusty-galaxy/)

Today’s authors discover a distant galaxy cloaked in dusty darkness,
and consider what it might reveal about galaxy evolution in the early
Universe

## Climate Literacy and Outreach

### [Solastalgia](https://indd.adobe.com/view/41f38e52-43eb-4921-bd08-3aec2b42230b)

Narrative I wrote about the feeling of solastalgia on a California road trip for Smith College magazine _Emulate_ (see page 37!)

### [Teaching Change: The Importance of Climate Communication](https://www.sigmapisigma.org/the-sps-observer/spring/2020/teaching-change-importance-climate-communication)

literacy across fields, and of my climate change education at Smith College

### [Comatose in Climate Catastrophe](https://publisher.abc-clio.com/9781440875427/)

Perspective I wrote on the psychological distance of climate change for _The Climate Change Debate: A Reference
