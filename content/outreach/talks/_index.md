At the biannual UT Astronomy Board of Visitors meeting in February 2023, I spoke about
my research on "bright and early" galaxies in the context of
COSMOS-Web. [Watch the public talk here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr0bOicV9XY)

In UT's Point of Discovery podcast, I was interviewed
about being a grad student during the first year of JWST. In it, I chat about the
excitement around JWST, my
science looking ahead to the JWST era, and the scientists who
inspire me. Listen to ["Right Place, Right Time"](https://cns.utexas.edu/news/podcast/right-place-right-time)
on the Point of Discovery podcast.

I was interviewed remotely for the Astronomy on Tap Jena in
Nov 2022, in a series highlighting junior
astronomers working on data from the recently launched space
telescope, _JWST_. The interview covered nearly every aspect of my
interests, starting with how I became interested in astronomy, to my
climate advocacy work and science writing, to my study of what I call
“bright and early”
galaxies. [Watch _"Did early galaxies go through climate change?"_ here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do8m0iR4i6k)
