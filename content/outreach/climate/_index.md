## Earth Week x Astrobites

### [Earth Week x Astrobites 2024](https://astrobites.org/earthweek2024/)

In 2024, our Earth Week theme centered around the intersection of
Indigenous science and Western science, specifically focusing on our
relationship to nature as scientists and students of nature.

### [Earth Week x Astrobites 2023](https://astrobites.org/earthweek2023/)

Our theme for 2023 focused on the question: How do I as a
[student / educator / science enthusiast] talk to people about climate
change?

### [Earth Week x Astrobites 2022](https://astrobites.org/earthweek2022/)

For our first annual Earth Week, we considered how to transfer our
(astro)physical skills for broader climate advocacy work?
