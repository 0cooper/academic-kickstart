Hey! I'm Olivia (she/her), an NSF fellow and final year PhD candidate at
UT Austin. I am a galaxy observer, and my research focuses
specifically on massive galaxies and their role within galaxy evolution in
the first half of cosmic time. I graduated from Smith
College in May 2020 with degrees in Astronomy and Physics and a
concentration in Climate Change.

In addition to my research on distant galaxies, I am also a science
communicator, a climate steward, and an advocate for equity and
justice in astronomy. I've written for [Astrobites](https://astrobites.org) for the
past four years, and co-founded the Climate Change Committee, wherein
we discuss topics at the intersection of astronomy and climate change and host
[Earth Week x Astrobites](https://astrobites.org/earthweek2024/)
annually. I co-chair the Outreach Committee of [COSMOS-Web](https://cosmos.astro.caltech.edu/page/cosmosweb), which
aims to engage the public with the science results from the
largest-area JWST legacy image. I am also co-founder of chOIR, a
collaboration with equal emphasis on studying galaxy evolution and bettering
astronomy culture.
